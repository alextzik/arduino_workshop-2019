This repository contains some of the code developed or used in the 'Arduino Workshop: Intermediate Level' organized by the IEEE Student Branch of AUTH and Thrace. The code enclosed in this repository may be incomplete and lacking proof-reading and checks. It nevertheless provides a quick understanding of the level and the content of the workshop.
The repository also includes a video of an assembled vehicle controlled through an app using bluetooth (project completed in the workshop) and a video of a personal project consisting of an ultrasonic 'radar'.
